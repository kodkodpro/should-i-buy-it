# ADHD-Optimized Purchase Calculator - Improvements

## 🎯 Goal
Help people with ADHD reduce impulsive purchases by emphasizing deliberation over instant gratification.

## 🔄 Major Changes

### ❌ Removed Metrics (Problematic for ADHD)

1. **Instant Happiness Score** - REMOVED
   - **Why**: Directly rewards dopamine-seeking behavior
   - **Problem**: Encourages impulsive thinking ("but it will make me happy NOW!")
   - **Replaced by**: Long-term Value + Use Frequency

### ✅ New Anti-Impulsivity Metrics (CRITICAL for ADHD)

1. **Waiting Period** (Days since first wanting) - **HIGHEST IMPACT (2.0x)**
   - 0 days = major red flag
   - 1-3 days = still impulsive
   - 7+ days = good deliberation
   - 14+ days = excellent clarity
   - **Why**: The "cooling off period" is proven to reduce impulsive purchases
   - **ADHD benefit**: Gives time for hyperfocus/excitement to fade

2. **Research Depth** (0-10) - **HIGH IMPACT (1.7x)**
   - Have you read reviews?
   - Compared alternatives?
   - Watched videos/read articles?
   - **Why**: Impulsive ADHD purchases involve zero research
   - **ADHD benefit**: Encourages deliberate investigation

3. **Impulse Resistance** (0-10) - **HIGHEST IMPACT (1.9x)**
   - How planned does this feel?
   - 0 = "I need this NOW!"
   - 10 = "This is a carefully considered decision"
   - **Why**: Self-awareness of impulsivity is protective
   - **ADHD benefit**: Forces honest self-assessment

### 🔧 Modified Metrics

1. **Discount Benefit** - **LOWERED IMPACT (0.8x → 0.4x)**
   - **Why**: Sales/discounts are major ADHD impulse triggers
   - **Problem**: "Limited time offer!" creates false urgency
   - **Solution**: Still considered, but much lower weight

2. **Upgrade Justification** - **Now Conditional**
   - Only appears if "Is Replacement" is checked
   - **Why**: Not relevant for new purchases
   - **ADHD benefit**: Reduces form fatigue

### 📊 New Core Value Metrics

1. **Long-term Value** (renamed from Sustainability)
   - Will this provide value for months/years?
   - **Impact**: 1.5x (HIGH)

2. **Use Frequency** (NEW)
   - How often will you actually use this?
   - **Impact**: 1.4x (HIGH)
   - **ADHD benefit**: Counters the "shiny new toy" effect

3. **Necessity Factor** (kept, increased weight)
   - **Impact**: 1.4x → 1.8x (HIGHEST)
   - **Why**: Critical distinction between wants and needs

   - 45-64: Wait & think more (was 40-59)
